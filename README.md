# Usage

## Installation

Create a new environment
```
conda create -n dptagent python=3.10 -y   # support python<=3.10
conda activate dptagent


# Install pytorch
# We do not need gpu
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio

# Installing dependencies

bash ./install.sh
```
## Running Instructions

### Set up LLMs

```
litellm -c llms/litellm/config.yml --port 40000

# check health
curl --location 'http://127.0.0.1:40000/health' -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-1234"
```


### Run LLM as Indenpendent System 1 and System 2 Experiments
For single agent exp, first change the config/envs/overcooked.yaml

```
mode: burger_exp1
...
num_agents: 1
```
Then run:
```
sh scripts/exp0/openai.sh
```

### Run Single Agent Experiments
For single agent exp, first change the config/envs/overcooked.yaml

```
mode: burger_exp1
...
num_agents: 1
```
Then run:
```
sh scripts/exp1/openai.sh
```

### Run Collaboration Experiments with Rule-baed Agents
For collaboration exp, first change the config/envs/overcooked.yaml

```
mode: burger_exp1
...
num_agents: 2
```
Then run:
```
sh scripts/exp2/openai.sh
```

### Run Human Experiment
For use map 2, change the config/envs/overcooked.yaml
```
mode: burger_aa_new
...
num_agents: 2
```
Then run:
```
sh scripts/overcooked/human_llm_app.sh
```
Then open the website http://localhost:5001

### Help
For more information, please run

```shell
python llm_agent_run_act.py --help
```


## Developing Guide

We recommend using pre-commit to unify the format before commit.

```
# Init
pre-commit install

# You can run manually (maybe multiple times)
pre-commit run --all-files

# or it will automatically run when you try to commit, which is slow and seems stuck.
```
